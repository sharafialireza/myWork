# Temperature API lookup by IP Address and Creating its Histogram 

This is a Python application that can an input file containing IP location of cities around the world and can lookup to 
find its weather forecasts. This program will plot a histogram of the temperatures found and save the plot as .png along with a 
TSV text format file of the results. The TSV file will contain two results: The count and the histogram edges. 

The use can choose the input file (containing the IP address as tsv format), the output file for the results of TSV format file 
and the number of buckets as follows:

    $ python3 city-forecasts.py --input IN_FILENAME.TSV --output OUT_FILENAME.TSV --bucket-count X

The histogram plot as .png will always be created as "hist_graph_temp.png". There is also another file generated for all types of 
logs generated during the application running including errors encountered. The log file is called "log-error.txt".

The application can also be run as docker container. The container image needs to be created using the Dockerfile included.


## Requirements

The Python application was created using Pyhton3.7 so it is recommended to use this version (or above) to avoid any possible issue
with older version of Python. There are several module required for this application to work properly which are given in the 
requirements.txt file.

The Python application can be rub from a Docker container. To successfully run this python application, you need
to install the following tools,

* docker - installed from [docker.io](https://www.docker.com/)
* python >= 3.7 - the python code is written and in python3, make sure you have proper python interpreter installed on your system
** python requests library - this is required for submitting multiple requests to the api server. You can run `pip install requests`
* pandas - open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.
* matplotlib - is a multi-platform data visualization library built on NumPy arrays for plotting 2D plots of arrays

## Running the application as a docker container

1- Create a directory on your computer, save the python application file along with input file (IP 
location as tsv) and the Dockerfile supplied with application in that directory.
2- The container is created by using the following command:

    $ docker build -t city-forecasts .

3- Make sure you can access the internet since the application make API calls to https://ipapi.co and 
https://api.openweathermap.org to fetch lat/long/city information and subsequently to fetch the 
temperature forecasts. If there is any failure, the log file will have an entry for it. The information 
about the fetched data will be also printed on screen for each IP selected from the input file.

4- To run the container image, run:

    $ docker run --mount -type=bind,source=/path/to/inputfile, target=/app --input in_filename.tsv  --output out_filename.tsv --bucket-count 10 city-forcasts

The printed information for a successful retrieval for an IP would be like:

    IP Value : 97.68.237.19
    Location:Melbourne, Florida, US
    today date: 2021-01-30
    forecasted temperature:
    31-01-2021: 70.56

### to chekc the list of image created after the container is created
 
    $ docker image list
    REPOSITORY                              TAG          IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
    city-forecasts                          latest       3712dadaef78   12 hours ago    597MB

### to check the status of the running container

    $ docker ps -a
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE            COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS                      PORTS     NAMES

### to stop a container

    $ docker stop my_container
